# Starflight Code Wheel

A digital code wheel for [Starflight][], a 1986 game by Binary Systems.
This is the game's copy protection system and is needed when leaving the
space station. This is essentially a clone of [Pat Shearon's program][r],
but without the hefty .NET requirement. If built using the 32-bit variant
of [w64devkit][], or a very old MSVC, it should run on computers as old as
Windows 95.
