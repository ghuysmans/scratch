# Personal scratch code

This repository is a pile of scratch mini-projects I've written over the
years that capture various experiments and lessons learned. When working
on other projects, I will sometimes harvest code snippets from this
scratch repository. Some of this code is complete, working, and tested,
but not sufficiently substantial to warrant its own repository. Some is
incomplete or half-baked. Almost all the code here is dedicated to the
public domain.
