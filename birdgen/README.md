# Bird Species Generator Turing Test

This program randomly selects a real North American bird species name,
then randomly generates three species that (hopefully) sound real, but
definitely are not real. It shuffles this list and then prints it. Your
job is to guess which is the real species. Hit RET to reveal which item
was the real species.
