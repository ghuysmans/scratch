# BrianVM: a programming challenge

BrianVM is a programming challenge I created in January 2020 for a friend
who just had a traumatic health experience and had endured a stay in the
hospital. He needed both a "brain exercise" and a good distraction, and I
thought this would fit the bill.

## BrianVM Specification

Memory is a 256-byte array containing both program and data. A program is
an array of 256 unsigned bytes loaded into this memory, and the program
may modify any byte of memory â€” i.e. it may be self-mutating. The machine
has one register, program counter (`PC`), which is initialized to zero.
The instruction set has 11 opcodes. An instruction is one opcode byte
followed by one or two operand bytes.  Out-of-bounds memory accesses are
impossible since only 256 bytes are addressable.

In the opcode specifications below, brackets indicate memory dereference
(as in x86).

    PUT: (opcode 0) [addr]

Output the byte at the address `ADDR`.

    MOV: (opcode 1) [dst] [src]

Copy byte from address `SRC` to address `DST`.

    ADD: (opcode 2) [dst] IMM
    SUB: (opcode 3) [dst] IMM
    MUL: (opcode 4) [dst] IMM
    DIV: (opcode 5) [dst] IMM
    MOD: (opcode 6) [dst] IMM

Add/sub/mul/div/mod 1-byte immediate with value at address `DST`, storing
result in address `DST`. Divide by zero is undefined. All operations are
unsigned and may overflow or underflow the result.

    RND: (opcode 7) [dst]

Store a random byte at address `DST`. How you generate it is up to you.

    SLP: (opcode 8) IMM

Sleep for `IMM` milliseconds. Must flush all output before sleeping
(important!).

    BRA: (opcode 9) abs

Unconditionally set `PC` to `ABS`.

    BRZ: (opcode 10) [test] abs

If the value at address `TEST` is zero, set `PC` to `ABS`.

## Sample program

Here's a program I made especially for Brian. Below are the 256 bytes in
hexadecimal. (No peeking at the ASCII values!) This program requires a
terminal supporting ANSI escapes at least as big as 80x24.
